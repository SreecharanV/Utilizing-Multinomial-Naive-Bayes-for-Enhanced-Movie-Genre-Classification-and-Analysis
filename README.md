## Introduction

In the constantly developing multimedia entertainment industry, particularly classifying movies into genres is a challenging yet essential task for more effective user suggestions and content management. This project provides a unique approach to this issue through using the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier on a mixed and diverse movie dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle. It contains a comprehensive collection of movie and TV show data from Netflix, including titles, directors, actors, country, year, and descriptions.

## Model

The Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier is particularly suited for this project due to its effectiveness in text classification and handling of categorical data. The model is trained on movie descriptions, leveraging the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectorization method to convert text data into numerical format.

### Environment Setup

- **Python**: 3.8 or newer
- **Libraries**:
    - Pandas
    - NumPy
    - Scikit-learn
    - Matplotlib
    - Seaborn
    - Jupyter Notebook

## Results

The model was evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier showed high precision in genre classification and outperformed traditional methods like Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machines.

### Visualization

Visualizations such as confusion matrices, bar plots, and line graphs were used to illustrate the model's performance. These visualizations help in understanding the strengths and limitations of the classifier.
